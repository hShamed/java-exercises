# Fourth Exercise

## Instructions

Write a Java program that uses a `while` loop to calculate and print the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 50 (inclusive).

### Requirements

- Use a `while` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50.
- Check if a number is even (hint: use the modulus operator `%`).
- Accumulate the sum of even numbers in a variable.
- After the loop, print the final sum using `System.out.println`.

### Example Output

```
The sum of even numbers from 1 to 50 is: 650
```

Good luck!
