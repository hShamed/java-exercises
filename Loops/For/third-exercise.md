# Third Exercise

## Instructions

Write a Java program that uses a `for` loop to print the years from 2025 to 2000, on each line you need to print all the months from 12 to 1.

### Requirements

- Use a `for` loop to iterate from 2025 to 2000.
- Print each year on its own line using `System.out.println`.
- Use a `for` loop to iterate from 12 to 1.
- Print each month on the same line of the year using `System.out.print`.

### Example Output

```
2025: 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
2024: 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
2023: 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
...
...
...
2000: 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```

Good luck!
